0.999_001 2013-08-05 06:43:11 Europe/London
	Development version for cpantesters prior to 1.0 release

	Features:
	* Updated for spdy/3 support.
	* Higher-level handling for streams and client/server
	modes, to avoid duplication of logic when implementing
	network transport
	* State notification via futures
	* Support for transfer windows
	* Dropped NOOP frame (nothing seems to use it, as a
	consequence we're only supporting spdy/3+ now - if
	older versions are required please raise an RT)

	Documentation:
	* Examples for client, server and debug usage
	* Next-protocol-negotiation is more widely available, so
	documented ways of using that
