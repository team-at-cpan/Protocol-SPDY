0.999_004 2013-08-08 21:36:58 Europe/London
	Features:
	* send_settings method for notifying remote of our estimated/current
	settings - needed for disabling server pusher (max_concurrent_streams=0)

	Bug fixes:
	* Initial settings notification method used incorrect ::SETTINGS class

0.999_003 2013-08-08 05:40:40 Europe/London
	Features:
	* Window update messages now handled by Protocol::SPDY::Stream,
	rather than leaving the implementation to send them manually.
	* Incoming settings frames are now applied
	* restore_initial_settings method for sending persisted values

	Bug fixes:
	* Length calculation was incorrect, this could cause undef frames.
	* ->headers method support in Protocol::SPDY::Stream, needed for
	proper server push support
	* ->window_update method support in Protocol::SPDY::Stream
	* FIN would cause remote_finished Future to fire before the data
	event was invoked

	Build:
	* Uses cpanfile for dependency tracking

	Documentation:
	* Mention some of the constants available in Protocol::SPDY::Constants

0.999_002 2013-08-06 04:59:45 Europe/London
	No functional changes

	Dependency fixes:
	* Attempt to get MIN_PERL_VERSION into Makefile.PL (the
	Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MinimumPerl module does not appear
	to do this, perhaps because Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker
	explicitly deletes that hash entry in favour of putting
	it as a 'use' line in Makefile.PL, unclear yet why this is)
	This version uses a patched Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker
	to avoid removing the MIN_PERL_VERSION key.

0.999_001 2013-08-05 06:43:11 Europe/London
	Development version for cpantesters prior to 1.0 release

	Features:
	* Updated for spdy/3 support.
	* Higher-level handling for streams and client/server
	modes, to avoid duplication of logic when implementing
	network transport
	* State notification via futures
	* Support for transfer windows
	* Dropped NOOP frame (nothing seems to use it, as a
	consequence we're only supporting spdy/3+ now - if
	older versions are required please raise an RT)

	Documentation:
	* Examples for client, server and debug usage
	* Next-protocol-negotiation is more widely available, so
	documented ways of using that

0.001     2012-03-03 22:41:48 Europe/London
